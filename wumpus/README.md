# Hunt the Wumpus

Hunt the Wumpus is a text-based adventure game implemented using Python and ncurses. The player must navigate through a series of caves to find and shoot the Wumpus, avoiding pits and collecting gold along the way. I originally created this version as a foundation for a ROGUE-like game I want to build out and this was a model for a line of sight algorithm using  Bresenhamâ€™s line algorithm and ray casting

## Features

- **Randomly Generated Map**: The game generates a random map with caves, tunnels, walls, pits, and gold.
- **Player and Wumpus Movement**: The player can move around the map, and the Wumpus moves randomly with a chance to chase the player.
- **Arrow Shooting**: The player can shoot arrows to try to kill the Wumpus. The arrows travel in a straight line and stop at walls.
- **Visibility**: The player can see 5 spaces in all directions, but visibility is blocked by walls.
- **Map Revelation**: The map is revealed as the player moves, and revealed areas stay visible.
